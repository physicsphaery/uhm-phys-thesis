With the utilization of the Askaryan Effect, the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna will seek to discover UHE neutrinos of extra-galactic origin.  After successfully completing an engineering test flight in Ft. Sumner, NM two years after the prototype flight in Antarctica with the TIGER payload, the fully integrated radio interferometer was constructed.  This chapter outlines the RF acquisition system, digitization scheme, and the overall functionality of the ANITA payload.
