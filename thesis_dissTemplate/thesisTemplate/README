This is a thesis/dissertation template created by Robert Brewer Copyright (C) 1998, adapted by Troy Hix, and modified by Jeff Kowalski.  I have created folders for each chapter for organization along with a folder for the APPENDIX, BIBLIOGRAPHY, and FIGURES.  The style file written by Robert Brewer for the University of Hawaii thesis/dissertation guidelines is uhthesis2e.cls.  You will hopefully not need to modify this file since it looks after all of the formatting necessary for meeting the UH policy.  My main thesis file is MScTHESIS.tex.  The documentclass call in this file allows you to switch from actual or proposal and thesis or dissertation.  The proposal mode does not print the paper double-spaced nor does it print the final cover/signature page.  Instead, proposal mode prints the version number which is very useful while you are submitting versions to your thesis/dissertation committee.  I should also mention that it is very helpful to download a bibliography style file that is used in your field.  For my thesis, I used the physRev style bibliography.  If you have any questions please email me at jeff.kowalski@hawaii.edu.
