Consider an optical setup where a laser beam line is intersected orthogonally at its focus by a receiver beam line. Let a coordinate system be centered at the intersection where the z-axis corresponds to the receiver beam line and the x-axis corresponds to the laser beam line (see Figure \ref{side_view_figure}). Ray bundles (corresponding to the sensitive phase space region for the CT103 monochromator) are transformed to the intersection and the overlap with focused laser beam is determined. Based on that overlap, an ``excited sensitive volume'' is defined at the target region for various two--lens combinations in the receiver beam line. The overlap will naturally include any cropping of phase space in the angular dimension. A solid angle of acceptance is defined and the excited sensitive volume is scaled by the ratio of this solid angle over $4\pi$. The surface formed by this scaled volume (as a function of lens focal lengths) is used to determine the optimal lens combination for laboratory scale versions of the side view geometry. See Figure \ref{side_view} for a resulting surface applicable to a bench top experiment.

Suppose we choose a symmetric pair of 200mm lenses (i.e. unity magnification), now we can examine the dynamic and geometric effects of the velocity distribution on the detection system. Using the same geometry as above, we construct a rectangular region at the intersection to represent the sensitive volume with respect to the detection system (the ``sensitive'' volume). The height of the region in the y--direction is equal to the height of the monochromator input slit. The width of the region in the z--direction and x--direction is equal to the width of the monochromator input slit. Laser beam excitation of the region is modeled by a second rectangular region (also centered at the intersection) which is temporally switched (top hat envelope with a width equal to the laser pulse length). The width of the region in the z--direction and x--direction is equal to the waist diameter of the laser beam. The height of the region in the y--direction is equal to the Rayleigh range of the laser beam.

An ensemble of molecules is generated in the sensitive region and tracked backwards in time, starting from some time $t$, to determine the average effect of molecular velocity on the ensemble dynamics at some instant. The ensemble is uniformly distributed in the volume and given the Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution (the velocities are isotropic). Each member of the ensemble is ballistically tracked and the duration and delay of its exposure to the excitation volume is recorded. The evolution of the (two level) molecule is calculated according to Equation \ref{final eom} and; thus, by averaging over the entire ensemble, the average probability of inversion is calculated for molecules in the detector's sensitive region at time $t$. This is repeated for many times $t$ to track the average behavior of the ensemble for some time interval. See Figures \ref{thermal_2} and \ref{thermal_200} for some results applicable to a bench top experiment.

Even if we assume all of the inverted molecules decay optically within the bandwidth of the detector, the collisional decay rate places limits on the number of photons emitted from the ensemble. If the collision rate dominates, it can be shown that (personal communication, Pui K. Lam, June 2006)

where $n$ is the number of emitted photons, $\tau_c$ is the collision life time, $\tau_s$ is the spontaneous life time, and $N$ is the number of inverted molecules. Using the above results we can obtain an estimate for the number of photons captured in the detection system. Assuming the density of molecular iodine at 293K is near $10^{21}$ per m$^3$, the scaled volume (from Figure \ref{side_view}) is near $2\cross10^{-12}$ m$^3$, the maximum inversion probability is near $6\cross 10^{-2}$ (down from around 0.6 -- see Figure \ref{thermal_200}), and $\tau_c/\tau_s=0.1\cross10^{-6}/7\cross10^{-3}\sim1\cross10^{-5}$ ($\tau_s$ is derived using the same matrix element mentioned in the caption of Figure \ref{thermal_2}); then the total number of photons captured in the monochromator should be near 1200. It should be noted that for the 2 ns pulse (Figure \ref{thermal_2}), even though the maximum inversion probability (0.6) is an order of magnitude larger; the ratio $\tau_c/\tau_s=1\cross10^{-9}/7\cross10^{-3}\sim1\cross10^{-7}$ is two orders of magnitude \emph{smaller} for a reduced number of captured photons when compared to the 200 ns pulse.
