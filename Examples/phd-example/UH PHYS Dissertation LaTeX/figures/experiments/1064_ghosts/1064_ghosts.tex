\caption[Grating ghosts from 1064 nm laser illumination]{Grating ghosts from 1064 nm laser illumination. Using various targets (aromatic compounds, paper, and a calibrated Lambertian target) it was discovered that the spectral ``features'' observed in the UV were independent of the target. Then from the data shown here, acquired using a notch filter made for 1064 nm YAG output, it was concluded that the ``features'' were linearly related in intensity to the 1064 nm excitation and thus most likely ``ghost lines'' associated with the grating.}
