\caption[Amplitude ``robustness'' of the two color STIRAP]{Amplitude ``robustness'' of the two color STIRAP. The optimal solution in Figure \ref{solution 2 pulses} is allowed to vary in pulse height by the ``scale'' factor (both pulses are scaled simultaneously) and the resulting residue, as defined by Equation \ref{phi prime} is plotted as a function of the scale. The narrow downward ``spikes'' are real; however, their depth may not be acurately displayed here due to ``aliasing'' effects between the regular spacing of computer generated points and the sharp spikes. In short, the residue is around $10^{-3}$ for most of the range of the ``scale'' factor, except for numerous ``pits'' where the residue drops to $10^{-6}$ or less.}
