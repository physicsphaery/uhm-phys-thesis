The output of the boxcar averager is connected to the vertical axis of a chart recorder. At each ``lambdalok'' setting the vertical position of the pen is recorded after the boxcar output stabilizes (the experimental repetition rate is 20 Hz and the ``samples'' setting on the averager is set to 300). See Figure \ref{absorption} for a plot of these data. The absorption peak (the ``peak'' points down) near 535.885 nm is the focus of the following discussion.

There are two transitions under investigation in this study. The first is the transition between the $\nu^{\prime\prime}=0$, $J^{\prime\prime}=52$ state in the X band to the $\nu^{\prime}=30$, $J^{\prime}=51$ state in the B band, called transition one hereafter. The second is the transition between the $\nu^{\prime\prime}=0$, $J^{\prime\prime}=55$ state in the X band to the $\nu^{\prime}=30$, $J^{\prime}=56$ state in the B band, called transition two hereafter.

Transition one has an excitation energy corresponding to 535.8843 nm while transition two has an excitation energy corresponding to 535.8901 nm. The resolution of the scan is high enough to identify the absorption feature associated with these transitions; however, the individual transitions are not resolved and may indeed prove difficult to resolve with this scanning method. The goal of this exercise was not to identify specific peaks; instead, we simply seek to verify the performance of the dye lasers (again, it is discovered the ``scan'' feature was unreliable) and observe the basic absorption features of molecular iodine.
