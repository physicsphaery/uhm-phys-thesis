The two energy levels in consideration here, $X$ and $B$, each consist of many sub levels due to the vibrational and rotational wave functions \cite{Herzberg:1950a}. The dependence of the energy levels on the nuclear spins is small; however, the symmetry properties of the nuclear wave function can still influence the energy transfer during collisions (and influence which molecules couple to the laser field) \cite{Sikora:1997a}. Since we plan to avoid time scales which would allow collisional effects to become significant, we will ignore the nuclear portion of the wave function. When the symmetry rules for dipole transitions between $X$ and $B$ are applied one finds that transitions where $\Delta J=0$ (``Q'' transitions) are forbidden leaving only $\Delta J = \pm 1$ (``P'' and ``R'' transitions).

The vibrational spacing is around 150 cm$^{-1}$ while the rotational spacing corresponding to the P and R transitions ($\Delta J = 2$) is about 10 cm$^{-1}$ for the Boltzmann populated transitions. Since kT is about 200 cm$^{-1}$ at room temperature we see that many rovibrational levels will have significant population within the X electronic state. In fact, there will be hundreds of occupied rovibrational levels in the X band, each connected to tens of rovibrational states (``only'' tens because of the selection rules: the initial and final vibrational states are not constrained; however, the rotational quantum numbers must obey $\Delta J = \pm1$), making thousands of transitions which one would have to track in a model of excitation and fluorescence.
