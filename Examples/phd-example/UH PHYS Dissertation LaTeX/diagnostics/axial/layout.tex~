We measure the RF spectrum of two dye lasers (\#22 and \#23) using two receivers (the 7L12 and the 7L14). Selection between the two laser sources is facilitated through the use of a mirror mounted on a magnetic kinematic base (called the ``switch'' in Fig. \ref{block}).

When the mirror is in place and the beam from dye \#23 blocked, the beam from dye \#22 is directed toward the photodiode. When the mirror is removed, the beam from dye \#23 is incident on the photodiode. Switching between laser sources takes seconds. To attenuate the beam down to appropriate levels for the photodiode, the laser output is reflected off the front surface of a wedged quartz plate - the rear surface reflection is directed toward a beam dump while the front surface reflection is directed through two crossed polarizers and three neutral density filters (ND 0.3, 0.7, and 2.0). After the ND filters the beam is incident the photodiode.

Before being analyzed by the receiver, the electronic signal from the photodiode is sent through a high pass filter (see Fig. \ref{highpass}

 for the response curve for the filter). A 14 dB attenuator is placed between the photodiode and the filter to minimize back reflections from the filter (see Fig. \ref{filter}

for the effect of the attenuator and filter on an actual pulsed signal from the photodiode). The SR250, triggered by the light scattered from the beam dump, gates and averages the receiver output. A laptop computer using the ``voltage ramp chart recorder'' LabView program (see AHI00-TP3300-01-VR03) simultaneously samples the boxcar integrator output and supplies a voltage ramp to the receiver. The voltage ramp scans the receiver across most of its usable range.
