The Stanford Research Systems SR250 Gated Integrator was used to temporally sample, amplify, and average the pulsed signal from the RF receivers. Even with a high pass filter between the photodiode and the receiver, the output from the receiver above 150 MHz was buried in the noise. The boxcar averager was required to retrieve the signal from the usable range of each receiver. When the receiver's center frequency is tuned down to about 130 MHz, a significant signal can be seen from the receiver (~15 mV). This signal is used to place the boxcar gate. See Fig. \ref{gate}

for a view of the oscilloscope during gate alignment. Once the gate is placed, appropriate gate widths, sensitivity settings, and sample numbers are selected. The boxcar gate is not temporally scanned in this experiment.
