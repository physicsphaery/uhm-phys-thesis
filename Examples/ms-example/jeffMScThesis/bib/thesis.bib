	(OM) installed in the clear ice below the South Pole Station. Each
	OM contains a photomultiplier tube (PMT) that detects photons of
	
	Cherenkov light generated in the ice by muons and electrons. ICECUBE
	is a cubic-kilometer-sized expansion of AMANDA currently being
	
	built at the South Pole. In ICECUBE the PMT signals are digitized
	already in the optical modules and transmitted to the surface. A
	
	prototype string of 41 OMs equipped with this new all-digital technology
	was deployed in the AMANDA array in the year 2000. In this
	
	paper we describe the technology and demonstrate that this string
	serves as a proof of concept for the ICECUBE array. Our investigations
	
	show that the OM timing accuracy is 5 ns. Atmospheric muons are detected
	in excellent agreement with expectations with respect to both
	
	angular distribution and absolute rate.},

	the effect in a dielectric medium
	
	of great potential interest to large-scale ultra-high-energy neutrino
	detectors: rock salt (halite), which
	
	occurs naturally in high purity formations containing in many cases
	hundreds of km3 of water-equivalent
	
	mass.We observed strong coherent pulsed radio emission over a frequency
	band from 0.215 GHz. A grid
	
	of embedded dual-polarization antennas was used to confirm the high
	degree of linear polarization and
	
	track the change of direction of the electric-field vector with azimuth
	around the shower. Coherence was
	
	observed over 4 orders of magnitude of shower energy. The frequency
	dependence of the radiation was
	
	tested over 2 orders of magnitude of UHF and microwave frequencies.
	We have also made the first
	
	observations of coherent transition radiation from the Askaryan charge
	excess, and the result agrees well
	
	with theoretical predictions. Based on these results we have performed
	a detailed and conservative
	
	simulation of a realistic GZK neutrino telescope array within a salt
	dome, and we find it capable of
	
	detecting 10 or more contained events per year from even the most
