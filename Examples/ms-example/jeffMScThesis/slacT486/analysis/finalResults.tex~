\section{Electric Field Reconstruction}
\label{ss:PulseRecon}
The electric field of the pulsed RF Cherenkov emission can be calculated using ~\ref{eq:heff}.  Each waveform has been zero-mean subtracted with a Gaussian window applied in the time-domain.  Figure~\ref{fig:hornWvfmPsd} shows a sample waveform from run 102 with the above corrections applied.

\noindent Effects due to cable corrections were negligible for this analysis due to the fact that the amplitude change was insignificant.  Furthermore, the TDS694C only has 3 GHz of bandwidth so a correction for the frequency roll-off of the oscilloscope is necessary.  A picosecond pulse was injected into the scope and the measured frequency spectrum was recognized to have significant contributions in power above the quoted roll-off from the manufacturer.  This effect, however, was not used as a correction to the data since the change in field strength was collectively unnoticeable.  A time-domain representation of the effective height was not calculated, so the electric field was calculated in the Fourier-domain with 1 MHz bin resolution.  A careful FDTD representation of the effective height may improve the quality of these results but was not taken into account for this result.

\par The theory in equation~\ref{eq:zhs} was derived for a pulse detected at a large distance from a shower initiated by a single particle.  In this case, we can treat the shower as a single source emitter with radiation coherent over the full length of the shower.  Figure~\ref{fig:fieldVsFreq} shows the measured electric field strength for several different antennas used during T486.

The lower frequency data was borrowed from Gor\-ham \textit{et al.}~\cite{ANITA.2007} measured with the ANITA instrument.  The high frequency data came from this work with the Standard Gain Horn which illustrates the roll-off of the Cherenkov radiation from electromagnetic showers in ice with frequency.}

\noindent The low-frequency data was extracted from Gorham \textit{et al.}~\cite{ANITA.2007} measured with upper and lower Seavey horns, bicones, and discone antennas.  The errors for the ANITA data are statistical, and are $\pm$40\% in field strength ($\pm$3 dB).  The high-frequency data was calculated from run 102 with the standard gain horn.  The standard Fourier transform\footnote{$E(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} E(t)e^{i \omega t} dt$} of the measured electric field was multiplied by a factor of 2 in order to agree with equation~\ref{eq:zhs}.  The uncertainty in these data is the rms (root-mean-squared) of the field strength for the entire run which yielded approximately $\pm$50\% error.  The theoretical curve was generated with $\mathcal{E}_{shower}$ = 2.86 $\times$ 10$^{19}$ eV and $\nu_0$ = 1.15 GHz.
