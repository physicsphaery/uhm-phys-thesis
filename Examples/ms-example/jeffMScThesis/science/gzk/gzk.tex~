\section{\textbf{GZK} Limit}
\label{s:gzk}
\par The main motivation to search for cosmological high-energy neutrino sources is derived from the theory that the cosmic ray energy spectrum extends to energies greater than 10$^{20}$ eV.  If cosmic rays follow an energy spectrum given by:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN}{dE_p} \propto E_{p}^{-2},
\label{eq:pwrLaw}
\end{equation}

\noindent we should see a steep cutoff occurring near 10$^{20}$eV due to the rapid decrease in particle flux.  The cosmic ray energy spectrum does not follow a perfect power law given by equation~\ref{eq:pwrLaw}.  The true spectrum has intrinsic properties shown in figure~\ref{fig:cosmicRayFlux} where the power law varies considerably.

\end{figure}

\par Above 10$^9$ eV, the CR energy spectrum can be described by a series of power laws, with the flux falling about 3 orders of magnitude for each decade increase in energy.  At the ''knee" ($\sim$10$^{15.5}$ eV), the spectrum steepens from E$^{-2.7}$ to E$^{-3.0}$ which is still not consistently explained after being discovered over 40 years ago~\cite{Kulikov.1959}.  Above $\sim$10$^{17.7}$ eV (''the dip"), the spectrum steepens further to E$^{-3.3}$ and then flattens out to E$^{-2.7}$ near the ''ankle" at $\sim$10$^{18.5}$ eV.  Sources above $\sim 3 \times 10^{18.5}$ eV are most likely extra-Galactic protons~\cite{Waxman.1998} produced from naturally occurring particle accelerators (i.e. AGN's, BL Lac's, GRB's, etc.).

\par In 1966, Greisen, Zatsepin, and Kuzmin~\cite{Greisen.1966,Zatsepin.1966} predicted that the flux of these UHE protons would be reduced via the process:

\begin{equation}
p + \gamma_{2.7K} \rightarrow \Delta^{*} \rightarrow n + \pi^{\pm}
\label{eq:gzk}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the decay chain of the $\pi^{\pm}$ leads to the flux of high energy neutrinos (''GZK $\nu$ flux")\footnote{$\pi^{+} \rightarrow \mu^{+} + \nu_{\mu}$, $\pi^{-} \rightarrow \mu^{-} + \bar{\nu}_{\mu}$, $\pi^{+} \rightarrow e^{+} + \nu_{e}$, $\pi^{-} \rightarrow e^{-} + \bar{\nu}_{e}$} which are observable to the visible edge of the universe, whereas CR's are limited to our local supercluster ($\leq$40 Mpc)\footnote{1 Mpc $=$ 3.0857 $\times$ 10$^{22}$ m}~\cite{ANITA.2006}.
