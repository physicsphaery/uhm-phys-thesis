\chapter{SLAC T486 Ice Target}
\label{ap:iceTarget}
As discussed in section~\ref{ss:iceTarget}, many independent measurements were made to assess the effect of surface roughness and to calibrate the slope of the carved ice surface.  Since the target was carved using various hand tools, a careful examination of the surface is necessary to further understand the Cherenkov emission leaving the target.

\par The target was assembled using $\sim$55 136 kg blocks of carving grade ice.  With the target enclosure empty, each block was carefully stacked inside forming a large rectangular prism.  The surface of the unified block of ice was then carved to create a $\sim$8$^{\circ}$ slope to prevent total-internal-reflection (TIR) of the emerging radiation from the electromagnetic shower.

\par After carving, a 13 $\times$ 6 element grid was produced that contained the length, width, height, slope along the x-axis, slope along the y-axis, and the position of the ice relative to the two walls of the target enclosure along the y-axis.  All angles were measured with a digital protractor while positional data was taken standard measuring tape.  I would estimate errors in length, width, height, etc. to be within $\pm$2 cm and angle uncertainties to be $\pm$0.5$^{\circ}$.  The surface data from the ice target is summarized in the following pages.

\chapter{Bases, Camps, \& Research Stations on the Antarctic Continent}
\label{ap:antMap}
During preliminary analysis of the ANITA 2006-2007 Antarctic flight, a comprehensive map of the continent was developed to assess possible man-made sources of EMI.  The first set of bases came from \textcolor{blue}{http://members.eunet.at/castaway/stations/aa-bases.html} which gave a detailed listing of all research stations on Antarctica from the late 1940's to the present.  In addition to bases and research stations, there were many expedition paths that could contribute to EMI.  The main expeditions that could provide GPS data of their trek were:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Correne, Erasmus, \& Coetzer
\item John Wilton Davies
\item Team N2i (Novo to Inaccessibility)
\item ITASE (International Trans-Antarctic Scientific Expedition).
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Another possible source of EMI could come from automated-weather-stations (AWS) that exist all over the continent to collect climate data.  A detailed list of the existing AWS stations was taken from \textcolor{blue}{http://amrc.ssec.wisc.edu/aws.html}.

\par The map was generated with a combination of \textsf{python}$^{TM}$, \textsc{matplotlib}, and the Basemap toolkit extension for \textsc{matplotlib}.  The topographic data was provided by the National Oceanic \& Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) with 20 m resolution\\ (\textcolor{blue}{http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/Datasets/ferret/data/}).  The generated map, figure~\ref{fig:antMap} uses a stereographic projection centered on the South Pole and displays all of the elevation data below 60$^{\circ}$ S in meters.  The 35-day flight path of the ANITA payload is plotted in solid \textcolor{red}{red}, bases and research stations are point-like squares, and the AWS stations are black x's.
