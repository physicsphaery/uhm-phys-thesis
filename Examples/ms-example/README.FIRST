I have provided a copy of my Masters thesis in the folder named "jeffMScThesis" and a template for a general thesis in a folder named "thesisTemplate".  It may be worth while to play with the template to get a feel for how the style file works before looking at how I structed my Masters thesis.  In the template directory, I have made a .pdf so you can view what the template creates.  In my thesis folder, there is a copy of the paper that was submitted to graduate division on August 3, 2007 in .pdf format.
