Though it is often stated that all this took place "thousands of years ago", this is a misstatement. The era in which this exodus took place is never clearly stated in the series itself; however various implications on-screen suggested the series was taking place concurrently with the broadcast of the episodes. That is, the Cylon War would have started somewhere around the year 978 AD (by our calendar), the destruction of the Colonies took place around 1978 AD, and most of the episodes of the series took place in the years 1978-79.
