This sitcom starred Gary Coleman as Arnold Jackson and Todd Bridges as his older brother Willis, two African-American children from a poor Harlem background whose deceased mother previously worked for a rich white widower Phillip Drummond (Conrad Bain), who eventually adopted them. They lived in a penthouse with Drummond's daughter Kimberly (Dana Plato) and their maid (they went through three during the show's run: Mrs. Garrett (played by Charlotte Rae), Adelaide (played by Nedra Volz), and Pearl (played by Mary Jo Catlett)) on Park Avenue in New York City. As Arnold, Coleman popularized the catch phrase, "Wha'choo talkin' 'bout, Willis?", which was popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s and is still mentioned in pop culture references today.
