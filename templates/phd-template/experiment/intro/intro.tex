Maybe the world is blind, or just a little unkind. Don't know. Seems you can't be sure, of anything, anymore. Although you may be lonely and then, One day you're smiling again. Every time I turn around I see the girl who turns my world around, Standing there. Every time I turn around, her sprit's lifted me right off the ground. What's gonna be? Guess we'll just wait, and see.
