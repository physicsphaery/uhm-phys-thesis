Well we're movin on up, 
To the east side. 
To a deluxe apartment in the sky. 
Movin on up 
To the east side. 
We finally got a piece of the pie. 

Fish don't fry in the kitchen; 
Beans don't burn on the grill. 
Took a whole lotta tryin' 
Just to get up that hill. 
Now we're up in teh big leagues 
Gettin' our turn at bat. 
As long as we live, it's you and me baby 
There ain't nothin wrong with that. 

Well we're movin on up, 
To the east side. 
To a deluxe apartment in the sky. 
Movin on up 
To the east side.
