In the not too distant future, 
Next Sunday A.D. 
There was a guy named Joel, 
Not too different from you or me. 

He worked at Gizmonic Institute, 
Just another face in red jump suit. 
He did a good job cleaning up the place, 
But his bosses didn't like him \&
they shot him into space! 


We'll send him cheesy movies, 
The worst we can find...(la! la! la!) 
He'll have to sit \& watch them all, 
Then we'll monitor his mind...(la! la! la!) 

Now keep in mind Joel can't control, 
When the movies begin \& end...(la! la! la!) 
Because he used those special parts, 
To make his robot friends -- 

ROBOT ROLL CALL (Let's Go!) 

Cambot (Pan Left!) 
Gypsy (Hi Girls!) 
Tom Servo (Hi Tall Guy!) 
Crooooooow (I'm The Wisecracker!) 

If you're wondering how he eats \& breathes, 
And other science facts...(la! la! la!) 
Then repeat to yourself its just a show, 
I should really just relax...For Mystery Science Theater 
3000....... Mike 

In the not too distant future 
Way down in Deep Thirteen 
Dr. Forrester and TV's Frank 
Were hatching an evil scheme 

They hired a temp by the name of Mike 
Just a regular Joe they didn't like 
Their experiment needed a good test case 
So they conked him on the noggin and they shot him into space 
(Mike: "Get me DOWWWN!") 

We'll send him cheesy movies 
The worst we can find (LA LA LA) 
He'll have to sit and watch them all 
And we'll monitor his mind 

Now keep in mind Mike can't control 
Where the movies begin or end (LA LA LA) 
He'll try to keep his sanity 
With the help of his robot friends

And other science facts (LA LA LA)
