During the course of this study, unique results were obtained and significant data were acquired. The most topical results include the effects of different LIDAR geometries when the phase space constraints of the detector system are taken into consideration, the increased target/non-target discrimination obtained by using three color coherent population transfer, the advantages of the ``satruation'' effect of the STIRAP process, and the modeling of the mode structure of the dye laser output using the Gauss-Leguerre resonator modes. The most significant data sets include a comparasion of LIF obtained from a modestly prepared iodine cell and a professionaly prepared cell, a demonstration of transition discrimination in the molecular iodine energy manifold, the dye laser RF beat spectrum, the dye laser transverse profiles, and the confocal etalon preformance as a mode analyizer/filter.
