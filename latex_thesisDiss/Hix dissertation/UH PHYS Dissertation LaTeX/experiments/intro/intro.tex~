The first measurement described is a broadband absorption experiment conducted in November 2003. The basic data acquisition instrumentation is assembled and a first generation iodine cell is tested. The development continues up to a measurement of the LIF from solid anthracene conducted in March 2006 when the ``ghost lines'' from the grating in the 1 m monochromator are revealed. For each measurement the resulting contributions toward instrumentation are highlighted.

The loading system for a custom re-loadable sample cell is not complete and will not be included here. Experiments at various buffer gas pressures will be conducted when the system is ready; however, multi-color single-mode experiments await capable laser systems. Current efforts are centered on the production of single mode high power pulsed output using a tunable diode laser ``idler'' source amplified with a YAG pumped dye cell.

\cite{Lewis:1993a} presents the absorption and LIF spectrum of molecular iodine. In this work we measure the absorption spectrum using LED's instead of a while light source and we generate the LIF spectrum using green HeNe output and dye laser output instead of red HeNe output. \cite{Koehler:1933a} reports the quenching of the total iodine fluorescence signal and \cite{Williams:1974a} measures the lifetime of individual LIF features; however, these measurements were conducted at low pressure (0.03 Torr). In this work we look at the decay of a single LIF line at relatively high pressures.
