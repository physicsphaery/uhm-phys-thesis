\caption{Rayleigh range (724 nm) and spot size vs. pinhole diameter - Even with a pinhole as large as 150 $\mu$m the Rayleigh range for the pinhole function is only 24.374 mm while the spot size 20 cm from the pinhole is 2.359 mm in diameter. For a pinhole with a diameter of 50 $\mu$m the Rayleigh range is 2.708 mm and the spot size at 20 cm is 7.076 mm.}
