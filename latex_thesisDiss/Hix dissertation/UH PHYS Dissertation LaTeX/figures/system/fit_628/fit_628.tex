\caption[DC test of 628nm coated Pockels cell]{DC test of 628nm coated Pockels cell. A base line photodiode reading (with the crossed polarizers and Pockels cell removed) was not recorded for these data; however, we expect the efficiency to be better than the green case in Figure \ref{fit_532} since the laser wavelength of 633nm is closer to AR coating wavelength.}
