\caption[Required fluence for inversion of the two level iodine molecule]{Required fluence for inversion of the two level iodine molecule. Here Equation \ref{required fluence} is plotted for various pulse lengths with $\Delta \tau = \pi/2$. To minimize the effect of collisions on the process, pulse length should be kept less that 1 ns when the target is at atmospheric pressure. A 1 ns pulse focused to a spot with a waist of 100 $\mu$m will need about 3 mJ to invert the two levels if we assume the ``medium'' coupling of $10^{-33}$ Cm. In an evacuated cell, one should be able to reduce the relaxiation effects to allow 100 ns pulses. In this case, the excitation beam (with the same 100 $\mu$m waist) must have over 180 mW of peak power, even when assuming ``strong'' coupling.}
