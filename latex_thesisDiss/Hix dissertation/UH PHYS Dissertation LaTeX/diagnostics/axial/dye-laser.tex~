The dye lasers used here are the Sirah Laser model PRSC-D-24 (dye \#22 and dye \#23) with the Lambda Lock feature. In addition to electrical power and computer control, these dye lasers require an external ``pump'' laser beam to run. The pump laser is the Continuum Powerlite Precision II Scientific Laser System: a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser running at the second harmonic (532 nm). The output of the YAG is split three ways and transported to the inputs of three dye lasers - the beam is stopped before the laser (dye \#21) not being used. DCM dye, from Exciton, was dissolved in Methanol to produce the 628 nm beam used in this experiment. The resulting dye laser output has the following properties: linearly polarized (vertical), 20 Hz repetition rate, $\sim$8 ns FWHM, and a pulse energy of about 58 mJ (38 mJ) for dye \#22 (dye \#23) at the laser output port.
