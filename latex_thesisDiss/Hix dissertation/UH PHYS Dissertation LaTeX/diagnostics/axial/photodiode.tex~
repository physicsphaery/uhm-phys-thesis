The detector used here is the Hamamatsu R1193U-03 photodiode (S/N 903). The key characteristic is that it has a large active surface area: about 2 cm in diameter. Thus, since our beam is less than 0.5 cm in diameter, we can be sure that a majority of the beam is incident on the active portion of the photodiode. Since only low light levels should be used with this photodiode, the signal from the photodiode was kept below 1 V (into 50 $\Omega$) even for low duty cycle laser output from the dye lasers. In this way we ensure there will be no damage to the large active area of the photodiode and its sensitivity will remain uniform over the entire area.
