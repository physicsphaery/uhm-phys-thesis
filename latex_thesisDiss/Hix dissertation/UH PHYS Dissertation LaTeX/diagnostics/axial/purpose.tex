In this study we observe the RF spectral content from the temporal intensity profile of the output of a pulsed dye laser system. The dye lasers were purchased with the intent to induce a coherent control process in molecular iodine as a demonstration experiment. The physical requirements of the desired process are strict: the dye laser pulses must be very close to the transform limit with a stable center frequency and amplitude (see AHI01-DN3300-14). It was not expected that these dye lasers would fulfill these requirements exactly; however, the degree to which they fail was not known. From the RF spectrum we gain information regarding the axial and spatial mode content of the dye laser output; additionally, we gain insight into the nature of the laser resonator cavity.
