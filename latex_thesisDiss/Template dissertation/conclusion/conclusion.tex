Look at what's happened to me, 
I can't believe it myself. 
Suddenly I'm up on top of the world, 
It should've been somebody else. 

Believe it or not, 
I'm walking on air. 
I never thought I could feel so free-. 
Flying away on a wing and a prayer. 
Who could it be? 
Believe it or not it's just me. 

It's like a light of a new day-, 
It came from out of the blue. 
Breaking me out of the spell I was in, 
Making all of my wishes come true-. 

Believe it or not, 
I'm walking on air. 
I never thought I could feel so free-. 
Flying away on a wing and a prayer. 
Who could it be? 
Believe it or not it's just me.

So this is the tale of our castaways,
they're here for a long, long time.
They'll have to make the best of things,
it's an uphill climb.
The first mate and his skipper too,
will do their very best,
to make the others comfortable,
in the tropic island nest.
No phones, no lights, no motor cars,
not a single luxury.
Like Robinson Crusoe,
it's primitive as can be.
So join us here each week my friend,
you're sure to get a smile.
From seven stranded Castaways,
Here on Gilligan's Isle.
