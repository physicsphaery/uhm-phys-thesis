During the 1983-84 season, Phillip Drummond was re-married to Maggie McKinney (Mary Ann Mobley and later played by Dixie Carter), a television aerobics instructor. Ms Carter was replaced after many run-ins with star Gary Coleman. She had one son, Sam McKinney (Danny Cooksey) from her previous marriage.

The television sitcom The Facts of Life (1979--1988) was a spinoff of Diff'rent Strokes, involving former Drummond maid Mrs. Garrett \cite{Ebery:1977a} as housemother of a dormitory at an all-girl private school.
