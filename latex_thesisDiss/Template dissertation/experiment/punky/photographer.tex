The building was managed by photographer Henry Warnimont (George Gaynes), an older bachelor. Punky quickly became friends with Cherie Johnson (Cherie Johnson), a young girl who lived upstairs in Henry's building with her grandmother Betty Johnson (Susie Garrett). Once Henry discovers Punky in the empty apartment adjacent his, he hears her story. The relationship between the two blossoms, and Henry eventually adopts Punky.

Her other friends are geeky Allen Anderson (Casey Ellison \cite{Rabitz:2000a}) and stuck-up rich girl Margeaux Kramer (Ami Foster).

Probably one of the most memorable episodes was built around the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, in which Punky hears about the deaths and her dreams of being an astronaut are nearly squashed. In the end, however, her schoolteacher and Henry, along with guest star Buzz Aldrin \cite{Danileiko:1994a}, both tell her that she should still follow her dreams.
