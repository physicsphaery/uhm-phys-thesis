without pay a license.

  ICEOWS has been tested in all versions of Windows 95,
 98, Me, NT 4.0, NT 2000 and XP. 

  This software has been checked against all known 
viruses at this day. The only guarantee you get with 
this version of ICEOWS, either expressed or implied, is
 that ICEOWS will take  up  a certain number of bytes
on a hard disk drive. The integrity of the data on your
hard  disk  is  your responsibility, not mine. However,
the functionality of this program has been tested to the 
best of my ability, I can take no responsibility for the 
loss or damage of your data, although all reasonable 
precautions have been taken to insure the stability and 
safety of this program.
